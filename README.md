Instructions :)

--> The Calendar API schedules the meeting/event.  
-->It is a flask app, runs on localhost:5000  
--> In another terminal, keeping the cwd as "\adk_hackathon" give the command "adk run personaliser_adk" and try it out!  
--> "personaliser_adk" --> the folder in which, \__init__.py, agent.py are present. 

--> Make sure to have the "credentials.json" in the same folder as the calendar_api.py, for it to work.  
--> Make sure to have the "GOOGLE_API_KEY" present inside "\personaliser_adk\ .env"
